# receptor_utils

Some tools I find useful for working with Ig receptor sequences, including support for allele sequence naming and 
the creation of custom IgBlast databases. Please see the [documentation](https://williamdlees.github.io/receptor_utils/_build/html/introduction.html)
for further details.

Changes in version 0.0.39:
annotate_j and make_igblast_ndm will now accept a germline set in AIRR Community JSON format, as an alternative to providing the set in FASTA format.

Changes in version 0.0.38:
Improve reporting of issues with conserved residues
Change URL for fetching IMGT reference sets to use https
